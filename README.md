Congratulations, the project is ready and you can now go through the various tests and launch them.

### Please note: the checkout tests require a paid version, so I'll have to rewrite them with basic functionality before they can be run for you. 
### Comments: Synchronisation between the mother directory and this one is done once a day at midnight, it can be started manually, ask me.
